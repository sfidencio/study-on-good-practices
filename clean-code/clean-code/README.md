# Clean Code Practices Summary

1. **Meaningful Names**:
    - Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes that convey their purpose.

2. **Small Functions**:
    - Functions should be small and perform a single task. Consider splitting functions that do multiple things.

3. **Avoid Unnecessary Comments**:
    - Code should be clear enough to minimize the need for comments. If comments are necessary, the code may not be clear.

4. **Consistent Formatting and Style**:
    - Follow a consistent coding style, including indentation and spacing, to enhance readability.

5. **Keep Code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**:
    - Avoid code duplication. Abstract repeated code into functions or classes.

6. **Use Exceptions Instead of Error Codes**:
    - Utilize exceptions for error handling instead of error codes, making code cleaner and easier to understand.

7. **Automated Testing**:
    - Write automated tests for your code, ensuring it works as intended and serves as living documentation.

8. **Don't Sacrifice Readability for Performance**:
    - Prioritize code readability over premature optimizations. Write clean code first, then optimize as necessary.

9. **Keep Functions Side Effect-Free**:
    - Functions should be pure whenever possible, meaning they shouldn't have side effects outside their scope.

10. **Favor Composition over Inheritance**:
    - Use composition instead of inheritance to build class relationships, promoting more flexible and loosely coupled code.

11. **Describe What Matters**:
    - Group and organize code such that the most important or interesting parts are easy to find.

12. **Limit the Number of Parameters**:
    - A function should have as few parameters as possible. If many are necessary, consider using an object to encapsulate them.

13. **Avoid Long Methods**:
    - Long methods are hard to understand. If a method exceeds the length of one screen, consider breaking it up.

14. **Code Organization**:
    - Organize classes and functions logically, placing related items close to each other.
